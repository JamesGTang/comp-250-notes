Algorithms
==========
#####Informal Definition
An algorithm is the specification of a sequence of instructions to be carried out by a processor.

Algorithms can be run on a computer, but not necessarily:

* The Mayans had algorithms to predict solar eclipses centuries in advance.
* Egyptians had algorithms to build pyramids.
* Indians had algorithms for factorizing polynomials.
* Greeks had algorithms to build all kinds of geometric constructions using only a compass and straight-edge.

An example of a compass and straight-edge construction:

    e.g. Compass and straight-edge construction
    Problem: angle bisection
        Input: An angle defined by three points AOB
        Output: A point C such that AOC = BOC
    Algorithm:
        Draw circle centered at O to find A' and B'
        Draw circles centered at A' and B' of the same radius to find C
        AOC and BOC will then bisect AOB


We will mostly be concerned with algorithms that can be run by computers, since they are much faster than we are.

Computer Science
----------------
####Definition
Computer science is the study of algorithms for computing machines.

####Formal definition of an algorithm
A well-ordered collection of unambiguous effectively computable operations that when executed produces a result and halts in a finite amount of time.

####What distinguishes computer algorithms?

* Instructions are executed very quickly
* Algorithms must be fully specified before execution
* Algorithms must be unambiguous

Grade School Algorithms
-----------------------
* Unary addition: taking a set A and a set B, their sum C will be the union of A and B. You have to count everything out individually.
* Unary multiplication: taking a set A and a set B, their product B will be the substition of each element of set A by a set B'.
